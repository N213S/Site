THE “I REALLY DON’T CARE, USE THIS, BREAK THIS, HAVE FUN FOREVER” LICENSE

Welcome, fearless user. Everything you see here—the code, scripts, documentation, configuration files, snippets of AI wizardry, and possibly a few lines that are just nonsense—is hereby released into the broadest, most generous, most uncontainable public domain dedication possible. In other words, it’s yours. Do what you want. Seriously.

You are free to copy it, modify it, merge it, publish it, distribute it, sublicense it, sell it, or even turn it into a musical. Combine it with other software, sprinkle it into a secret AI project, use it to control a cat army, or just laugh at it at 3 AM. Commercial, non-commercial, government, alien, or underground lab projects—all are explicitly allowed. There are no restrictions. None. Zero. Nada.

In all jurisdictions that recognize copyright law, the authors hereby dedicate any and all copyright interest in this software to the public domain. This includes every version past, present, and future. This dedication is an overt act of relinquishment. Heirs, descendants, relatives, or anyone else who might fancy claiming a right to this software: too bad. Forever. Globally. Permanently. Your lawyers can try, but they will fail. Seriously, try if you want.

The software is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind. That means:
- There is no promise it will do what you expect.  
- There is no promise it won’t break spectacularly.  
- There is no promise it won’t anger your cat, crash your server, or summon a small army of vengeful gremlins.  
- Authors are not responsible for anything, anywhere, ever. Legal, financial, or existential consequences are all yours.  
- If your project goes up in flames, your computer melts, or a black hole forms (please don’t), that is entirely on you.  

You are encouraged to:
- Remix, refactor, rewrite, or burn it and start over.  
- Translate it into Klingon, Morse code, or interpretive dance.  
- Share it, sell it, gift it, or use it to prank your friends.  

You are not required to:
- Give credit (but it would be polite and make the authors happy).  
- Release improvements back to the community (though sharing is highly encouraged, because sharing is caring).  
- Do anything other than accept the freedom and responsibility that comes with using this software.

This license is intended to be crystal clear: the purpose is **full public domain dedication**. Nothing herein should be interpreted to create obligations, restrictions, or liabilities inconsistent with that goal. The authors make no claims, warranties, or representations. Any resemblance to laws, regulations, or sanity is purely coincidental. You have been warned.

For those who want the boring, official, legalese-approved version: <https://unlicense.org>. That version is short, concise, and much less amusing, but conveys the exact same rights and freedoms as this text.

In conclusion, this software is yours to use, abuse, remix, destroy, improve, or worship as you see fit. Take it, break it, sell it, love it, hate it, or write a novel about it. The only true rule is that there are no rules, except that **all risks, consequences, and hilarity are entirely yours**. Go forth, brave coder, and unleash chaos responsibly… or irresponsibly. It is entirely up to you.
